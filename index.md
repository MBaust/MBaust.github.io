## Who I am

Hi, my name is Max and I enjoy combining algorithms and computing to bring mathematical concepts to life and create novel and innovative applications. Being a passionate facilitator as well, I like to connect industry and academia to make technological innovations usable and advance all individuals sharing the same passion.

In particular, I am interested in applications of machine learning, differential geometry, and numerical techniques to problems in machine vision and image understanding. Good examples include the selected publications listed below.
